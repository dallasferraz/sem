Structural equation modeling of a data set (survey results). Summer 2015 internship at MIT.

Work developed under the tutoring of [Dr. Perez-Franco](roberto.mit.edu/about). Application of Structural equation modeling tools and techniques in order to assess whether hidden factors were behind team performance in a competition. Here are provided files with raw data regarding both teams ranking position in the competition and several questions asked afterwards to each member of each team privately. The results of this study show interesting information regarding the structure of the very questions asked and hidden factors that contributed to positive group performance in the competition. Real information (name of the participants and name of the teams) were changed for privacy.
